	<p>Hello everyone! Like the title says, my name is Willie Ching. I was born and raised in Hawaii and just recently moved out here to Utah. Bach in Hawaii I was going to School at BYU-Hawaii and graduated last June with a defree in Computer Science. My favorite part in schooling was learning to code for websites and eventually make my own. This is why I joined this bootcamp. To get a springboard into a career in Web Development and to hone my coding skills.</p>
	<p>As far as my interest...I love sports, especially basketball and football. I played basketball during my time in college. I loved going to the beach, hiking, and going on road trips. Basically anything involving being out in the sun. I also enjoy being lazy from time to time and playing video games.</p>
